# Restaurant-Python-SQL-Application

This application is a Python application linked to MySQL using docker to store information entered by the user via the terminal command line using the menu selections and directly entering the information. The application stores Products, Couriers and Orders information in a database and also caches all information from database locally at the start of the application and each time a change is made.

This application was created to learn Python in visual studios and SQL commands and linking of MySQL with the help of Docker. 
It is just a application to showcase what was learnt in a few weeks of learning about Python and SQL.
